# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using NeuralÂ Network

<img src="img/MNIST.png" width="80%"/>

This repo builds a 4-layer neural network from scratch to recognize the MNIST Database of handwritten digits

## Getting Started
The example implements these concept:
* Weight Initialization
* Layer
  * ReLu
  * Softmax
* Training
  * Backpropagation
  * Gradient Descent
* Loss
  * Cross-entropy Loss

  
## Running the Codes

Code is provided in jupyter.you can modify the learning rate, epoch and batch size.

Use test function to show the test images by ```opencv``` and print the predicted result.

## Results

* batch size: 1
* learning rate: 0.001
* epoch: 5
* final loss: 0.1
